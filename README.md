# FinalProjectRealEstateSearch-1
Final Project Data Structures


**Description:

This project allows user to insert, delete and sort a node of real estate house objects. This allows for easy finding of either list price or bedroom size.  

****The programmer can go in and add many houses before even running the program if needed.  The user has the option to add any nodes as well.
****The programmer can also change the specs of the search (ie. can sort by if the house has a basement)
